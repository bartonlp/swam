<B>A GUIDE TO TRAINING
PROCEDURES AND-ETIQUETTE</B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER >
<U><B>(Excerpt from An Introduction to Westside Masters by Chris Georges)</B></U></P>

<P>
When trying to get 20,
30, or 40 people into a confined space and all headed in the same
direction, little things become important. While we're not suggesting
that a gentleman leap out of the pool and offer his spot in the lane
to every female who comes along, Emily Post would cringe to see what
goes on at some lap-swimming locations.</P>

<P>
In order to help
eliminate bestiality at practices, here is a suggested guide.</P>

<P>
<U><B>Be On Time</B></U></P>

<P>
When the coach is faced
with an unruly mass of swimmers which he must somehow transform into
smoothly functioning lanes full of happy and cooperative
athletes, it does not do
for you to show up just as he has completed the labyrinthine task of
making lane assignments. It can ruin his day-and yours: the coach can
decide not to let you swim. Get to the pool on time.</P>

<P>
The corollary to the
above maxim is this: if you're late, you're last. If you join a lane
where a set is in progress, don't expect to go anywhere in the lane
except last. And not an aggressive, hard-charging last-but a safe
distance back, a distance not even once threatening to come close to
the swimmer in front of you, and certainly not getting in the way of
the lead swimmer if he or she is about to lap you. (They were there
first, on time.)</P>

<P>
<U><B>Deviants</B></U></P>

<P>
Any time you're doing
anything other than the set exactly the way it was prescribed, you
forfeit your right-of-way. That means if you're kicking instead of
pulling, if you're going breaststroke instead of backstroke, if
you're stopping to rest in the middle of a 200, even if you're just
quickly fixing your goggles, stay our of the other people's
way.</P>

<P>
<U><B>Staying Out of the
Way</B></U></P>

<P>
The most-appreciated lane
partners are like the most-appreciated dancing partners: if you can
avoid stepping on the other person's toes, you're doing fine, and if
you're so good that the other people in your lane don't even have to
think about your presence, you'll probably have a marriage proposal
before the music stops.</P>

<P>
The usual trouble spot is
the wall. See that big, black &quot;T&quot; on the wall? That's a
turning target. Know what happens when you hang on the wall in front
of that &quot;T&quot;? You become the target-and most experienced
swimmers have a deadly accurate aim. Never stop on the wall in the
middle of a lane. If someone's coming up hot on your heels, stay to
the far ri9h! corner of the lane. If you have to stop and fix your
goggles and no one's back there, you can pick either side of the
<U>lane-but get to the corner.</U></P>

<P>
When you're finishing a
repeat, touch the wall, check your time, and slide over as far left
as you can go, so that the other swimmers can get to the wall as
well.</P>

<P>
A real finesse move,
suggested only for those with a high degree of savoir faire, is
knowing how to &quot;pass without passing.&quot; Let's say you're
swimming a set of, say 150's. You're coming up on the 100 turn, and
someone really slow is coming to the wall ahead of you. When you're
about 5 yards from the wall, knowing that no one is right behind you,
you whip a quick U-turn and reverse direction on the other side of
the lane. Of course, this throws off your repeat time a little bit,
but you've avoided a potential entanglement and kept moving.</P>

<P>
<U><B>Swimming Circles
and Splitting Lanes</B></U></P>

<P>
Unless otherwise agreed
upon by both swimmers in the lane, always swim in a counterclockwise
direction, staying on the right-hand side of the lane as you swim
down it (unless you're on your back, in which case it's the left).
The effect is not unlike that of driving your car on the highway-you
always stay on the right (unless, of course you're in England).
Dreadful results can be avoided in this way. This is known as
&quot;swimming circles&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;swimming
circles around [someone]&quot;).</P>

<P>
If and only if there are
two swimmers in a lane, they may agree to &quot;split&quot; the lane
(also known as &quot;swimming sides&quot;), with each swimmer
remaining on one side or the other. This allows two different
intervals to be swum in the same lane, the only time this should be
done (see next section).</P>

<P>
<U><B>What's an Interval?</B></U></P>

<P>
Intervals are the
backbone of modern swimming training. There are two kinds of</P>

<P>
intervals: we'll call
them <U>rest intervals</U> and <U>repeat intervals.</U></P>

<P >
Rest intervals are the
simplest kind to handle. If the coach says, &quot;We're going ten
100's freestyle on 10 seconds' rest,&quot; what he means is that
you'll do 10 repeats of 100 yards or meters apiece, resting 10
seconds between each 100. All you have to do is look up at the pace
clock when you finish each 100, wait 10 seconds, and then go again.
Simple.</P>

<P>
Repeat intervals are a
bit tougher. If the coach says, &quot;We're going ten 100's freestyle
on 1:40,&quot; then you've got a minute and 40 seconds to complete
each 100 and get whatever rest you can.</P>

<P>
This means you've got to
look at the pace clock as you start each 100, and note your starting
time. Say the second hand is on the :30 when you start. That means
that when you swim your 100, come to the wall, look at the clock and
see the second hand at :55, you've got until the :10 to go again,
because the :10 would represent a minute and 40 seconds (1 :40) since
you left on the :30.</P>

<P>
Sound complicated? Well,
it can be. Pay attention, LOOK AT THE PACE CLOCK EVERY TIME YOU START
AND FINISH A REPEAT, and start thinking in <b>base-60</b>. Your sanity
and that of those around you will depend on it.</P>

<P>
<U><B>The Pace Clock is
God: Thou Shalt Have No Other Bozos Before It</B></U></P>

<P>
The pace clocks keep
practice sessions from disintegrating into spawning runs. Masters
swimmers are assumed to possess mental (and visual) faculties equal
to the task of reading intervals off pace clocks. If that assumption
is erroneous in your case, better get a sports watch, so that you can
set your intervals on it and leave the thinking to the watch.</P>

<P>
Little mercy is shown
those who violate the sanctity of intervals, either through ignorance
or forethought.</P>

<P>
Once your lane is given
an interval for a certain set, you may not change that interval.
There are only two exceptions to this: (1) when the coach changes the
interval for you, and (2) when <U>everyone</U> in the lane agrees to
change the interval (or when you're splitting the lane).</P>

<P>
If you've got three
people in a lane, and two are doing 75's on one interval while the
third is doing 75's on another interval, soon people will be swimming
on top of one another. This is not good. In fact, this is very bad.
Maintain your interval, or change it unanimously. As a courtesy, let
the coach know you're changing it.</P>

<P>
Once you've got your
interval decided upon, always go on the interval. That means, if John
Smith in front of you stops between 100's to fix his goggles, don't
wait for him. You go when you&rsquo;re supposed to go, according to
the pace clock.</P>

<P>
<U><B>Space Yourselves
Apart</B></U></P>

<P>
If you understand that
each lane in a 25-yard pool has two sides, you see that each lane has
50 yards of swimmable space. If there are four people in your lane,
therefore, ideally each person will, at any given time, have 12 &frac12;
yards in which to swim.</P>

<P>
This means that there is
no need to swim right on someone's heels. In general, go at least 5
seconds apart when beginning a set.</P>

<P>
<B><U>Breaches of
Etiquette</U></B></P>

<P>
...are dealt with in
various ways. Once you've committed a major faux pas, you are fair
game for killing glances, cutting remarks and vicious blows to the
midsection as you pass by. The coach may also take actions, including
not sending your family a greeting card for the holidays. Moral: swim
softly and carry a sharp mind.</P>

<P>
<U><B>But Always Remember...</B></U></P>

<P>
This is not a life-or-death pursuit. When you're cranking out your lifetime best
series of 200's, and you're in the middle of your next-to-last repeat
when some bozo stops on the wall right in front of you-don't kill
him. Have a sense of humor. We're all in this to have fun. Smile at
the guy, say, &quot;That's all right; don't worry about it,&quot;
then when he's in the locker room getting dressed, go out to the
parking lot and slash his tires.</P>
