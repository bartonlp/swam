I'm writing this as a tribute to a good friend who will be greatly missed.
I met Steve like so many others at a swimming pool. For me it was the
Pierce College pool about 28 years ago. I had decided I needed to start a 
exercise program and was told Steve was running a masters swim workout in
the afternoon. I showed up and met his daughter Jennifer who was coaching
the workout because Steve was at the masters national swim chanpionship 
meet. The following week when he came back, he placeded second in his age
group in the 100 backstroke, Jennifer introduced us. From there the
friendship started. He helped me improve my swim stroke and 
encouraged me to take up another stroke, mine was the breaststroke. Over
the next couple of years he encouraged me to start competing in the local
masters swim neets. The first meet I competed in was the first turkey
shoot at the Pierce pool. From there Steve got me into rough water 
swimming and eventually the La Jolla rough water swim. I also found out
that Steve liked to snow ski, he was faculty monitor for the Cleveland HS
ski club. Steve ashed me to help him during many of the ski trips to
Mammoth Mountain as a van driver and chaperon for the kids. Steve and I
enjoyed many days on the slopes of Mammoth. Steve taught math at Cleveland 
for 40 years, and he also coached the swim team for a number of years. 
Steve eventualy turned over the Cleveland swim team to another coach and
the ski club was stopped. He also turned over the Pierce masters program 
to Fred. Steve continued on with the SPMA and ran every local meet. If you 
went to a swim meet you could alway find Steve because he had on his 
pith helmet. He also helped out at all of the high school championship
swim meets. He continued to help out at the high school meets and run 
the masters swim meets even after he started chemotherapy. Over the 
years we enjoyed each others companionship at swim meets, on the ski
slops, and over a beer or two. Steve you will be greatly missed.

The SWAM family loses a cherished member, a pioneer. In so many respects, Steve was the heart and soul of the SWAM family. A great man who led an ordinary life - at least by the world's standards - but a man who touched so many, many people both directly and indirectly. We are all blessed for having known him. He faced his various ills with aplomb and humor and courage. He loved swimming, and being around it and the people involved with it. The meets won't be the same without him on the microphone commenting on the weather, the events, the swimmers and any other little thing that came to mind. I couldn't list all the stuff I learned from Steve: stuff about swimming, stuff about my prostate, stuff about cancer and medical procedures and stuff about life. One of my cherished swimming memories will always be walking onto the deck one day and having Steve present me with an All-American patch and certificate, an honor that was earned on a relay team with Steve and Parry O'Brien, who also passed away recently. His time in the 10-mile swim was two minutes faster than mine. Way to go, Steve! Most of you know we've been involved in an effort to rename Pierce Pool in Steve's honor. That effort continues.

<P>My heart is heavy with the loss of this great friend. David's words cut right to the core of many of our relationships with Steve--showing a humble man who is comfortable in his own speedo and willing to look you in the eye, if only to show you the sparkle in his. I feel better for knowning Steve and hope our efforts to name the pool in his honor are sucessful. Sleep well my friend, you are missed already.

<P>So sorry to hear about Steve===I met him in La Jolla---and helped him stuff envelopes for one of his many projects last year==he was always so cheerful and fun to be around---I will miss him ---</P>

<U><B>From Aaron Robinson</B></U></P>

<P> I first met Steve when I was a 9-year-old youngster at Pierce back in 1986, swimming for Chooch on the Stingrays.  He was always a fixture at the evening practices, and remained a friend and mentor for the duration of his years.  Always a nice person to have on the pool deck, and as an administrator of the La Jolla Rough Water Swim, Steve dedicated a great deal of his life and effort to swimming and mentoring the younger and older swimmers. He is greatly missed by the Pierce community and his memory will always live on at the Pierce pool.  Miss you Steve. </P>
