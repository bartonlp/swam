<p>You may check the <a href="uploads/">upload directory</a> to see what is there.
If you upload a file with the same name as one that is in the directory the original
file will be renamed with a random (unique) value added to the end of the filename.</p>
<p>You may also download file from the upload directory as you would form any
HTTP directory.</p>
