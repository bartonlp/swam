<title>How to Spell Check</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Spelling Checker</h1>
<hr>
<p>If you are using Internet Explorer and have Microsoft Word on your system then you can download
this <a href="spellcheck.js">script</a> to your PC and then follow these simple instructions.</p>
<p>Put the script ("spellcheck.js") in a directory where you can find it. Then open IE and click on the
"View" item on the menu bar. Click "Toolbars | Links". The item "Links" needs to be checked. Once it is
checked you will see a "Links" item next to the "Address" or "Location" text box on the far right of the
screen. The "Address" text box is where you enter the name of the web page you want to visit.</p>
<p>Now open the Explorer and navigate to the folder (directory) where you saved the script you just
downloaded. Drag the script to the "Links" button and drop it.<\p>
<p>To the right of the "Links" button is a ">>" symbol which means there is more stuff to view.
Click on the ">>" and you should see "Shortcut to spellcheck.js" at the bottom of the list of links.
Right click on the link and select "Rename" and change the name to "Spell Checker" or whatever turns you
on.</p>
<p>Now when you enter text in a web page box you can spell check it by highlighting the text (sel1ect the
text) and then select "Spell Checker" from the "Links" bar. Word will start and the text will appear in word.
The Word spelling checker will be active. When you finish correcting the text a pop-up will ask you if you
want to accept the correction or not. If you say yes then the corrected text will replace the original
text. Your friends will think you actually passed third grade from now on.</p>
<p>I have not come up with a simple way for people that have not given into the dark-side and are not using
the evil empire's products yet. I will try to come up with a simple way to use "Mozilla" and maybe "Open Office"
instead of IE and Word. After all Bill really doesn't need the money and we don't need the pain!</p>

<h2>Possible Problems With Virus Software</h2>
<p>Some anti-virus software may ask you if you want to allow the script to run. The script is plain text so
if you have any doubts you can open the file and look at it. If you are still afraid say "NO" and just
keep on writing in BACHIE we will all giggle but understand.</p>
